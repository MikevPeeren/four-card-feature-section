## My process

I have developed using a Desktop First approach. I implemented the background/headers etc before moving on to the Card component where I first implemented the layout before I added the content.

### Built with

- Desktop-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - Stylesheet language
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework

### What I learned

I have learned a bit more about flex positioning.
